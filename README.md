# Property Value Analysis Model

## Project Overview
This project predicts property prices using machine learning regression models.
It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
- `train.csv` – training dataset with house features and prices
- `test.csv` – testing dataset
- `data_description.txt` – description of features

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

## Results
The Gradient Boosting achieved the best performance.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries
3. Run `Property_Value_Analysis_model.ipynb`

## Output
The model predicts house prices based on input property features.
